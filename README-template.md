## My process

1. I used flexbox to achieve responsiveness;
2. BEM, sass mixins and functions to make my code reusable;

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Bem is very usefull but am l would focus on how to reduce the use of BEM classnames. It makes my code longer with many classnames;
